# Running the project in dev mode
As for right now you need to run 2 different commands one for the front-end and one for the fake backend (json-server).

### Fake backend
```sh
cd fake-backend
json-server index.js
```

### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
ng serve
```
It will be served at **[localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**
